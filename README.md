Manufacturer documentation for 2-channel module: [NOYITO  5V 2-Channel Micro USB Relay Module User Manual.pdf](https://github.com/corndog2000/NOYITO-USB-Relay-Module-GUI/blob/main/NOYITO%20%205V%202-Channel%20Micro%20USB%20Relay%20Module%20User%20Manual.pdf)

**If you are using a 2-channel relay module then you can safely ignore the Relay 3 and Relay 4 buttons.

![This image shows a graphical user interface for a "4-Channel USB Relay Control" application. The window contains a serial port selection dropdown showing "COM5 - USB-SERIAL CH340 (COM" selected, a "Refresh Ports" button, and a "Connect" button. Below these is a status indicator showing "Status: Disconnected". The main section labeled "Relay Controls" has four rows of controls, one for each relay (1-4), with "ON" and "OFF" buttons for each. At the bottom is a note about ensuring CH340 drivers are installed. The interface appears to be running on Windows.](https://github.com/corndog2000/NOYITO-USB-Relay-Module-GUI/blob/main/interface.png)
